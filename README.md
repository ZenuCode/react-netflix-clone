# Fakeflix Website

# Webpage Logic
- React
    - Project was built with React using SCSS and Material UI to assist design
    - Services with TMDB API to obtain & use movie data
    - Trailer and Video was completed with npm-react-youtube within the movie-details component
    - Environment variables for API within Dotenv & Firebase Token Security for sensitive information
- DB
    - Instead of MongoDB, I wanted to try something new which I implemented the project with Firebase
    - I chose Firebase because I wouldn't be using a diverse amount of data which if well structured would
      make it easier for me to handle data.
    - Advantages: Real-Time Data, Authentication, Easy to Setup,
    - Disadvantages: Security Rules were a bit complex compared to MongoDB, If more data were added performance would cause an issue
- DB
    - Firebase
